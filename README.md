# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Polkadart
- **Team Name:** JURIMETRIC TECNOLOGIA LTDA.
- **Payment Address:** BTC, Ethereum (USDT/USDC/DAI) or Polkadot/Kusama (aUSD) payment address. Please also specify the currency. (e.g. 0x8920... (DAI))
- **[Level]:** 2
<br><br/>
## 📄 Project Overview 

### 📌 Overview

- Polkadart is a Dart library that provides a clean wrapper around all the methods exposed by a Polkadot/Substrate network client and defines all the types exposed by a node. It's an equivalent to [polkadot-api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) written in Dart language.

- Development of a library that allows users to connect to Polkadot/Substrate’s nodes on Flutter platform. 

- Our team is developing a ranking-based voting system based on the Substrate's based blockchain and for that, we need to create the Dart-substrate library. Today, there are multiple mobile applications built on Flutter and, until now, there is no possibility to connect to Substrate's nodes. 
<br><br/>
### 📌 Project Details

- An overview of the technology stack to be used:
```kotlin
This library will be written purely in Dart technology from scratch.
```
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed:
```kotlin
We will follow Polkadot specifications and, as a license for PolkaDart library, we will use Apache 2.0.
```
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement:
```kotlin
This project will not support legacy metadata protocols, such as metadata v9, v10, and v11.\
Polkadart will not implement any front-end, since it is going to allow developers to use Dart to
connect to the Substrate based network.
```
- This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious:
```kotlin
Polkadart is similar to the project "https://github.com/polkadot-js/api" but for Dart, instead of JavaScript.
```


### 📌 Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Our project is going to allow developers to use Dart/Flutter to connect to the Substrate-based network.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our target audience is the mobile app developer's community.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Polkadart enlarges the range of tools compatible with Polkadot/Substrate, therefore expanding its usability.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
Pocket 4 Polkadot-Dart: https://github.com/Pocket4D/Polkadot-Dart#manually-build
Polkaj: https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj/blob/master/docs/03-rpc-client.adoc
  - If so, how is your project different?
Pocket4 was similar to PolkaDart but it was discontinued for lack of progress and Polkaj is related to Java.
